      An education state of emergency has been declared in Nigeria, due to a lack of funding. Nigeria spends about 8% of its budget on education; UNESCO recommends 25%.
      Public high schools in Nigeria have practically collapsed over the years because of poor funding leaving millions of children out of school as well as receiving poor education. Nigeria has the highest number of children out of school in the world. 80% of Nigerian children who complete primary school cannot read.  More than half of high school students in Nigeria are in public schools owned by the Federal and State Governments.
      New World Bank reports that there’s robust scientific evidence that spending on education boosts growth better than investment in physical infrastructure.
      You can help uphold every child’s right to an inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all in line with UN SDGs Goal 4.
